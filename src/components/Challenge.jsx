Participants will study the FIS ecosystem using publicly available products and API documentation. Submissions will include a theme-specific pitch deck that outlines defined problem statements and how the proposed solution--offered either as a standalone option or via the FIS Code Connect API marketplace--can deliver innovation in fintech. Participants can also suggest new APIs that may help to enhance the solution further.</div>
